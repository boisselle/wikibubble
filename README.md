#	The aim of this project is to be able to	#
#	visually look at the big picture of a page	#
#	on Wikipedia. The main functionality should	#
#	allow putting in a link into a box, having	#
#	a home-made scraper grab the data, and then	#
#	parsing the data. Then, for the front end,	#
#	we must display the links on that wikipedia	#
#	page as bubbles. You should be able to click 	#
#	on the bubbles, and they will take you to 	#
#	the bubble map of the chosen bubble.		#
#	The link text is displayed on the bubble.	#
