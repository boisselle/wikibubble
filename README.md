#	The aim of this project is to be able to	#
#	visually look at the big picture of a page	#
#	on Wikipedia. The main functionality should	#
#	allow putting in a link into a box, having	#
#	a home-made scraper grab the data, and then	#
#	parsing the data. Then, for the front end,	#
#	we must display the links on that wikipedia	#
#	page as bubbles. You should be able to click 	#
#	on the bubbles, and they will take you to 	#
#	the bubble map of the chosen bubble.		#
#	The link text is displayed on the bubble.	#

#	USE CASE WORKFLOWS:				#
#	A user will be greeted by a single page with 	#
#	a small amount of information regarding		#
#	the tool, along with a suggestion for its use	#
#	and finishing with a call to action for the	#
#	user to enter a piece of text into the field.	#
#	After this has been initiated, there is a 	#
#	check on whether it is a valid wikipedia	#
#	and if it is not, then a proper display page	#
#	comes up. 					#
